# Rocket Project -- Circuit 

## Description
Implementation from: [Supplier](https://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=C6864)

This kit uses a 9-volt battery to power LEDs in a rocketship shape. Since it was a Learn to Solder Kit, some of the parts were practice parts and did not affect the circuit. (what kind of sensors, what kind of circuit, how does this work, how does power flow)
